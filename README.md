# HTML-CSS-PROJECT
This is my first ever project on Front-end development, it based upon HTML and CSS.
This project is all about a photography page, in which the major functionality is the working of hamburger icon.
On clicking the hamburger icon, a sidebar will open, on which some options will be visble.
And on clicking the cross button the whole sidebar will close.
This project can be counted as a minor one.

Thank You.
